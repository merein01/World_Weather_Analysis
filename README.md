# World_Weather_Analysis

# Overview

For this analysis, we creared a database of cities based of their latitude and longitudes. We generated the nearby cities data using citipy module. Next we pulled weather data from IOpenWeatherMap by using our API key and combining that into a Dataframe. Afterwards, we filtered our cities list based on preferred temperatures for vacation by generating a map of hotes nearby each city that met the prefered temperature requirements using the API Key from Google Maps. We chose a few cities to use within our preferred cities database to create a vacation itinerary by creating a visualization direction of these on the Google maps. Lastly, we crated a map using gmaps that showed our vacation itinerary cities and their weather deatails using markers on the map.
